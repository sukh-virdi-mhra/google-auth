# Server

This folder contains all of the back-end code

## Running the server

Once you have downloaded the repository, to run the server you first have to navigate to the `/server` directory, install all dependancies, and run the start command. See steps below:

- From root directory type `cd server` into your terminal
- You will now be in the server directory, in this directory type `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Once dependancies have installed type `npm start` to start the server

Once the server has started, you should recieve a message in the console with the servers URL, accessing this should return a confirmation message.
