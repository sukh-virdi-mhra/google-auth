# Client

This folder contains all of the front-end code

## Running the client

Once you have downloaded the repository, to run the cleint you first have to run the server, following this navigate to the `/client` directory, install all dependancies, and run the start command. See steps below:

- Start the server application (see README located in the server folder for steps)
- From root directory type `cd client` into your terminal
- You will now be in the client directory, in this directory type `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Once dependancies have installed type `npm start` to start the client

Once the client has started, you should recieve a confirmation message in the console, and the application should launch in a new internet tab.
